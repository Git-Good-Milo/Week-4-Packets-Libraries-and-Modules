# Libraries, Packages and Modules :taco:

This class will cover what is in the title

### Definitions 

#### Libraries
These are external but buiult into python / standard in python.
you need to import them to use.
These are still considered Vanilla python.

#### Modules
These are internal, and you import them to use elsewhere in the code.
We bukit lots of them in the loop but they can also be funtional

#### Packages
These are external and need to be installed.
You can install them using PIP or using Pycharm.

Pycharm creates its own Virtual Environment (VE) to avoid cross contamination
